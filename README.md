# Kickstarter-Analysis

# Overview
Louiseâ€™s play 'Fever' came close fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She has requested that I use the Kickstarter dataset that I worked through as means to show her how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Therefore, I visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
